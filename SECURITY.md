- Transaction state management
- Audit trail logging

**Note:** This is a frontend-only simulation. In a production environment, you would need:

- Backend API with proper authentication
- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS)
- Database encryption at rest
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- OWASP security guidelines
- PCI DSS compliance for payment data

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- Type-safe code with TypeScript
- Input sanitization patterns
- Secure coding practices
- Audit logging concepts
